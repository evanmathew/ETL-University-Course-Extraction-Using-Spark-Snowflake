On August 15, 2023, the University of Central City released the new course catalog for the Fall 2023 semester. Among the new offerings, Dr. Maria Thompson's "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" course (CS-457) quickly became the most anticipated. Scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM in Room 302 of the Engineering Building, the course promises an in-depth exploration of neural networks, deep learning, and AI ethics.

Enrollment for CS-457 opened at 9:00 AM on August 20, 2023, and within the first hour, 150 students had registered, maxing out the course capacity. Dr. Thompson noted that the course would include a mid-term project worth 25% of the final grade, a final exam (40%), and weekly assignments (35%).

Another popular course is "Environmental Sustainability" (ENVS-203) taught by Professor James Green. This class, held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM in the Science Hall, Room 210, covers topics such as renewable energy, conservation strategies, and the impact of human activities on ecosystems. The final project, a group presentation on a chosen environmental issue, accounts for 30% of the grade, while quizzes and participation make up the remaining 70%.

In the Humanities Department, the "Modern Literature" course (LIT-310), led by Dr. Emily Clark, offers a deep dive into contemporary works from around the globe. The course meets on Fridays from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the Liberal Arts Building, Room 114. Students are expected to read a novel each week and submit a reflection paper, which constitutes 50% of their grade. The other half is split between a mid-term essay (25%) and a final comparative analysis (25%).

For those interested in business, "Entrepreneurship and Innovation" (BUS-305) with Professor Alan Rivera is a must. Scheduled on Mondays from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM in Business Center, Room 101, the course explores startup culture, venture capital, and business model development. Assessments include a business plan presentation (40%), a case study analysis (30%), and class participation (30%).

In addition to these courses, the University announced a new "Data Science Certificate Program" starting in September 2023. This program includes five intensive modules: Introduction to Data Science, Data Wrangling, Statistical Methods, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. Each module is two weeks long, with classes held every weekday evening from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The total cost of the program is $2,500, and students who complete all modules will earn a certificate recognized by industry partners.

By the end of the registration period on September 1, 2023, the university had enrolled over 1,200 students across the new courses and programs, highlighting the growing interest in these fields. The administration is planning to add more sections to accommodate the high demand and is considering hybrid models to offer flexibility to the students.
