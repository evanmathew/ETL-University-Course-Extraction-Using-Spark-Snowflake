On August 15, 2023, the University of Metropolis released the new course catalog for the Fall 2023 semester. Among the new offerings, Dr. John Smith's "Advanced Robotics" course (ROB-501) quickly became the most anticipated. Scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM in Room 101 of the Engineering Building, the course promises an in-depth exploration of robotic systems, automation, and AI integration.

Enrollment for ROB-501 opened at 10:00 AM on August 21, 2023, and within the first hour, 200 students had registered, maxing out the course capacity. Dr. Smith noted that the course would include a mid-term project worth 30% of the final grade, a final exam (40%), and weekly assignments (30%).

Another popular course is "Climate Change and Policy" (CCP-205) taught by Professor Laura White. This class, held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM in the Science Hall, Room 220, covers topics such as climate science, policy responses, and global impacts. The final project, a policy analysis on a chosen climate issue, accounts for 35% of the grade, while quizzes and participation make up the remaining 65%.

In the Humanities Department, the "World History" course (HIS-315), led by Dr. Sarah Johnson, offers a deep dive into historical events and figures from around the globe. The course meets on Fridays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM in the Liberal Arts Building, Room 210. Students are expected to read primary sources each week and submit a reflection paper, which constitutes 40% of their grade. The other half is split between a mid-term essay (30%) and a final research paper (30%).

For those interested in business, "Marketing Strategies" (MKT-308) with Professor Michael Brown is a must. Scheduled on Mondays from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM in Business Center, Room 102, the course explores marketing theories, consumer behavior, and strategic planning. Assessments include a marketing plan presentation (45%), a case study analysis (35%), and class participation (20%).

In addition to these courses, the University announced a new "Cybersecurity Certificate Program" starting in October 2023. This program includes five intensive modules: Introduction to Cybersecurity, Network Security, Threat Analysis, Ethical Hacking, and Cybersecurity Management. Each module is two weeks long, with classes held every weekday evening from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The total cost of the program is $3,000, and students who complete all modules will earn a certificate recognized by industry partners.

By the end of the registration period on September 5, 2023, the university had enrolled over 1,500 students across the new courses and programs, highlighting the growing interest in these fields. The administration is planning to add more sections to accommodate the high demand and is considering hybrid models to offer flexibility to the students.
